# Problem A. Square

## Statement

Tsuu has learned that the square of a number is the number multiplied by itself. For example, the square of 3 is 3×3=9.
He wants to know the square of a number, but he is too lazy to multiply. Help him to find the square of a number.

## Input

The first line contains an integer T (1≤T≤1000) — the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The only line of each test case contains an integer N (1≤N≤1000) — the number whose square you need to find.

## Output

For each test case, print the square of the number.

## Example

### Input

```
2
3
4
```

### Output

```
9
16
```

## Note

In the first test case, the square of 3 is 3×3=9.

In the second test case, the square of 4 is 4×4=16.
